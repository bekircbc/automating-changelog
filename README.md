# automating-changelog

## Conventional Commit Messages:

Follow a standardized commit message format (e.g., Conventional Commits) that includes a prefix indicating the type of change (e.g., feat, fix, chore). Tools like commitizen and commitlint can enforce this format and automatically generate changelogs based on commit messages.

Example: Commit message: feat: Add new feature XYZ

## Changelog Generation Tools:

Use tools like conventional-changelog, auto-changelog, or standard-version to automatically generate changelogs based on commit history and version tags.

Example: Running npm run release to automatically generate a new version, update the changelog, and create a new Git tag.

## Release Notes Automation:

Integrate release notes generation into your CI/CD pipelines. Automatically generate release notes based on commit messages, pull requests, or issue tracker data.

Example: Automatically appending release notes to the changelog file during the CI/CD process.
